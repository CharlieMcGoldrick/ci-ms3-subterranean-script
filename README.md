# Subterraneon Script

The project, "Subterranean Script," is my innovative approach to the text-based, choice-driven adventure genre, deeply rooted in the spirit of iconic Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books. It adds a unique twist by plunging players into a sprawling, enigmatic dungeon world, with their destiny dictated by the doors they elect to pass through.

Drawing inspiration from the rich tradition of Dungeons & Dragons, Subterranean Script incorporates a series of well-established rules and mechanics from the legendary tabletop game. This blend of elements aims to enrich the gameplay experience, inviting players to engage with a complex web of decisions that mirror a D&D campaign's depth and dynamism.

At its core, Subterranean Script aims to capture players with its layered, immersive narrative and dynamic choice-driven gameplay, challenging their decision-making skills at every turn. It is meticulously crafted for those who appreciate the immersive allure of traditional text-based games but crave an additional level of interactive mystery and suspense, reminiscent of a well-rounded D&D adventure.

Whilst the player has the choice of left and right, this choice will be populated by a dictionary. This design will help for expansion in later scripts. In the first sprint I plan to have the first room and then a choice to enter the second room, but this diagram is an example of how it would be in the future.
